## Inspiration

As young adults, we don't know a whole lot about personal finance, but we think it's important to learn about.  It's good to learn about personal finance early so that we can start planning on how to become financially secure down the road. We thought this checklist was a good place to start learning about the different steps to take to ensure economic stability.  We figured that we weren't the only people who didn't know much about personal finance but wanted to learn more, so we created this project! We followed a flowchart from r/personalfinance as a guideline 

## What it does

This webapp works as a checklist to help you keep track of your progress in becoming financially secure and gives recommendations on how to save your money. There is also a FAQ and resources page for people with questions and people who want to learn more. 

## How we built it

We built it using HTML, css, and JavaScript. We used local storage in JavaScript instead of a database for times' sake. 

## Challenges we ran into

This was our first time using the localstorage property of JavaScript, so that was especially challenging. We also didn't have too much experience with JavaScript as a team, so we were able to learn a lot through this project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Being able to successfully use local storage to store some of the information on our page
- Building a project that can be helpful to others
- Meeting new people and working well as a group to make a project we're all proud of

## What we learned

We learned a lot about JavaScript and used new properties to make our project better

## What's next for "Pearl"-sonal Finance Hacker

- Maybe switch to using a database instead of local storage
- Allow users to log in with google instead 
- Have a budget tracker to help users keep track of their finances as well
